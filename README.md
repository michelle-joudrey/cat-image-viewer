# cat-image-viewer
My submission for a programming challenge.  
The application downloads and caches cat images from placekitten.com, displays them in a UICollectionView, and allows the user to take a closer look at them.

#### Build instructions
1. Install the CocoaPods with `pod install` in the project root.
2. Open `cats.xcworkspace` and build as usual.

#### Software used:
- Xcode Version 7.0 beta 4 (7A165t)
- CocoaPods 0.38.2
- ruby 2.2.1p85 (2015-02-26 revision 49769) [x86_64-darwin14]
